how the shell script will behave with single and double inverted comma

In shell scripting, single quotes (' ') and double quotes (" ") are used to define strings, and they have different behaviors:

Single quotes (' '):

--> When a string is enclosed in single quotes, the shell treats it as a literal string.
--> Variable substitution and command substitution within single quotes are not performed.
--> Special characters within single quotes are treated as ordinary characters and are not interpreted by the shell.
Example: 'Hello World' or 'My name is $name' - the variable $name will not be expanded.

Double quotes (" "):

When a string is enclosed in double quotes, the shell performs variable substitution and command substitution within the string.
Variables within double quotes are expanded to their values.
Special characters within double quotes, such as $, !, or backticks (`), are interpreted by the shell.
Example: "Hello $name" - the variable $name will be expanded to its value.

wow to get the process id of the script?
echo "${$}"  --> process id
echo "${ppid}"  --> parent process id
