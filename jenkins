Can you list few ways by which we can trigger our build in Jenkins? (a) Trigger builds remotely : If you want to trigger your project built from anywhere anytime then you should select Trigger builds remotely option from the build triggers. You’ll need to provide an authorization token in the form of a string so that only those who know it would be able to remotely trigger this project’s builds. This provides the predefined URL to invoke this trigger remotely.
(b) Build after other projects are built If your project depends on another project build then you should select Build after other projects are built option from the build triggers.

In this, you must specify the project(Job) names in the Projects to watch field section and select one of the following options:

Trigger only if the build is stable Note: A build is stable if it was built successfully and no publisher reports it as unstable

Trigger even if the build is unstable Note: A build is unstable if it was built successfully and one or more publishers report it unstable

Trigger even if the build fails

(C)Build periodically: If you want to schedule your project build periodically then you should select the Build periodically option from the build triggers. You must specify the periodical duration of the project build in the scheduler field section

(D)GitHub webhook trigger for GITScm polling: A webhook is an HTTP callback, an HTTP POST that occurs when something happens through a simple event-notification via HTTP POST.

GitHub webhooks in Jenkins are used to trigger the build whenever a developer commits something to the branch. note:et’s see how to add build a webhook in GitHub and then add this webhook in Jenkins.

Go to your project repository. Go to “settings” in the right corner. Click on “webhooks.” Click “Add webhooks.” Write the Payload URL as

 (E) Poll SCM:
Poll SCM periodically polls the SCM to check whether changes were made (i.e. new commits) and builds the project if new commits were pushed since the last build.

You must schedule the polling duration in the scheduler field. Like we explained above in the Build periodically section. You can see the Build periodically section to know how to schedule. 19. What is the difference between Build Periodically and Poll SCM?

how to secure jenkins?
o secure Jenkins, you can follow these best practices:

a) Enable Security: Jenkins has a built-in security feature that allows you to control access and authentication. Enable security 
in Jenkins by going to "Manage Jenkins" > "Configure Global Security" and select the appropriate security realm (e.g., Jenkins' 
own user database, LDAP, or other authentication methods).

b) Use Strong Passwords: Ensure that all user accounts have strong passwords to prevent unauthorized access. Encourage users to
follow password best practices, such as using complex and unique passwords.

c) Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Implement RBAC to control user permissions and restrict access to specific Jenkins resources. 
Define roles with appropriate permissions based on user responsibilities.

d) Audit Logs: Enable audit logging to track and monitor user activities within Jenkins. This allows you to identify any
suspicious or unauthorized actions.

e)Plugin Security: Regularly update Jenkins and its plugins to the latest versions to ensure you have the latest security patches. 
Remove or disable any unused or outdated plugins to reduce the attack surface.

f)Securing Jenkins Server: Apply general security practices to the Jenkins server itself, such as keeping the operating system and 
other software up to date, using firewalls to restrict network access, and securing SSH access.

g)Securing Jenkins Agents: If you use Jenkins agents (also known as slaves), ensure they are securely configured and accessible 
only to authorized users.

i)Backup and Recovery: Regularly back up your Jenkins configuration, jobs, and settings to a secure location. This ensures you can
restore your Jenkins instance in case of any data loss or system failure.

j)HTTPS/SSL: Configure Jenkins to use HTTPS with SSL certificates to encrypt the communication between clients and the Jenkins server.
This helps protect sensitive information, such as login credentials, during transmission.

k)Continuous Monitoring: Implement continuous monitoring solutions to detect and alert on any security issues or anomalies within 
your Jenkins environment.

Remember that security is an ongoing process, and it's essential to stay updated on the latest security best practices and vulnerabilities. Regularly review and update your security measures to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of your Jenkins instance.
