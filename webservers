1)How to check web server logs in apache2?
A web server log is a text document that contains a record of all activity related to a specific web server over a defined 
period of time

The tail command is a useful tool for viewing the last few lines of a file. It can be used to quickly check the Apache web 
server logs in Linux. To use the tail command, open a terminal window and type the following command:
tail -f /var/log/apache2/access.log

This command will display the last few lines of the Apache access log. You can also use the tail command to monitor the log in real-time.
To do this, add the -f flag to the command:
tail -f /var/log/apache2/access.log
/var/log/apache2/error.log.

This will display the log entries as they are written to the log file. This is useful for monitoring the 
server in real-time and troubleshooting any issues that may arise.
