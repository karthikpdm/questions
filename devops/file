How you manage credentials in jenkins.
ChatGPT
In Jenkins, credentials can be managed using the built-in Credentials plugin. This plugin allows you to securely store and manage 
various types of credentials that are used by Jenkins jobs, such as usernames/passwords, 
SSH private keys, API tokens, and more.

Here are the steps to manage credentials in Jenkins:

Install and configure the Credentials plugin: If the Credentials plugin is not already installed, you can install it from the Jenkins 
Plugin Manager. Once installed, you may need to configure additional settings, such as encryption options.

Create credentials: In the Jenkins web interface, go to "Manage Jenkins" and then click on "Manage Credentials". From there, you can 
create different types of credentials based on your requirements. Provide the necessary information for each credential type, such as 
the username, password, or private key.

Use credentials in Jenkins jobs: Once you have created the credentials, you can use them in your Jenkins jobs. For example, when 
configuring a job that requires authentication to access a Git repository, you can select the appropriate credentials from the 
available options.

Secure credential storage: It's important to ensure that credentials are stored securely in Jenkins. Avoid exposing sensitive 
credentials in job configurations or logs. Jenkins provides the option to reference credentials by their ID instead of directly 
exposing the sensitive information.

Additionally, you can manage credentials programmatically using the Jenkins API and various Jenkins plugins that integrate with 
external credential stores or secret management systems, such as HashiCorp Vault or AWS Secrets Manager.
